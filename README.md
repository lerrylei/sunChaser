# sunChaser
Sun Chaser is a semi-autonomous robot that aims to fully optimize the power of renewable solar energy. Equipped with a double axis solar tracker and two robust DC motor wheels, Sun Chaser will bring solar panels to the next level. This project was made as part of Cornell Maker Club's 24 Hour 2023 Makeathon.
